# 🕒 Digital Clock using JavaScript

This is a simple digital clock built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The clock updates every second to display the current local time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (linked via `dt.css`)
- Vanilla JavaScript (for real-time updates)

## 📸 Preview

The clock looks something like this:

```

\[ 10 : 45 : 23 ]

```

It updates every second to reflect the current system time.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure `dt.css` is in the same folder as your `index.html`.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## 📁 File Structure

```

/project-folder
├── index.html       <-- Main HTML file
├── dt.css           <-- Your CSS file (for styling the clock)

```

## 🧠 How It Works

- HTML provides the structure and placeholders (`<span id="hrs">`, etc.)
- JavaScript fetches the current time every second using `setInterval()`.
- DOM manipulation updates the text content of each `<span>` with the current hour, minute, and second.

## ✨ Features

- Live clock display
- Simple, minimal layout
- Easy to customize

## 📌 To-Do / Enhancements

- Add AM/PM format
- Add dark/light mode toggle
- Style the clock with animations or themes

## 📄 License

This project is open-source and free to use. Feel free to modify it for your own needs.

Would you like me to generate the matching `dt.css` as well?
